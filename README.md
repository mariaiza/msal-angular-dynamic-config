# msal-angular-dynamic-config
Encountered issue when implementing a dynamic configuration on my Angular app using MSAL Library. Creating here a workaround as it is uncertain when MS (MSAL) team or Angular will allow it. This workaround is a summation of all the things gathered from StackOverflow and GitHub that have worked with Angular 11 and MSAL 2.0.2.
